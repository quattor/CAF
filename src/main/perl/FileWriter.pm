=head1 NAME

CAF::FileWriter - Class for securely writing to files in CAF
applications.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Normal use:

    use CAF::FileWriter;
    my $fh = CAF::FileWriter->open ("my/path");
    print $fh "My text";
    $fh->close();

Aborting changes:

    use CAF::FileWriter;
    my $fh = CAF::FileWriter->open ("my/path");
    print $fh, "My text";
    $fh->cancel();
    $fh->close();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class should be used whenever a file is to be opened for writing.

If the file already exists and the printed contents are the same as
the contents present on disk, the actual file won't be modified. This
way, timestamps will be kept.

It also provides a secure way of opening files, avoiding symlink
attacks.

In case of errors, changes can be cancelled, and nothing will happen
to disk.

Finally, the file names to be handled will be logged at the verbose
level.

=head2 Gory details

This is a wrapper class for C<IO::String> with customised close based on
C<File::AtomicWrite>.

=head2 Public methods

=over

=item new

Returns a new object. It accepts the file name as its first argument,
and the next hash as additional options:

=over

=item C<log>

The log object. If not supplied, no logging will be performed.

=item C<owner>

UID for the file.

=item C<group>

File's GID.

=item C<mode>

File's permissions.

=item C<mtime>

File's modification time.

=item C<backup>

Path for the backup file, if this one has to be re-written.

=item C<keeps_state>

A boolean specifying whether a file change respects the current system
state or not. A file with C<keeps_state> will be created/modified,
regardless of any value for C<NoAction>.
This is useful when creating temporary files that are required for a NoAction run.

By default, file changes modify the state and thus C<keeps_state> is
false.

=item C<sensitive>

A boolean specifying whether a file contains sensitive information
(like passwords). When the content of the file is modified, the changes
(either the diff or the whole content in case of a new file) themself
are not reported and not added to the event history.

=item open

Synonym for C<new()>

=cut

# Alias open to new.
no warnings 'redefine';
*open = \&new;
use warnings;

=item close

Closes the file.

If the file has been saved (e.g. previous C<close> or C<cancel>)
nothing happens and undef is returned.

If the file has not been saved,
it checks its contents and perhaps re-writes it, in a
secure way (not following symlinks, etc). The (re)write only occurs
if there was a change in content and this change (or not) is
always determined and returned, even if C<NoAction> is true
(but in that case nothing is (re)written).

Under a verbose level, it will show in the standard output a diff of
the old and the newly-generated contents for this file before actually
saving to disk.

=cut

# If the C<original_content> atttribute exists, it is used to determine
# whether or not there was a change and a consequent write; unless
# the C<original_from_source> attribute is true
# (e.g. in case of C<CAF::FileEditor> with C<source> option).
# If C<original_from_source> is true, changes to the C<orginal_content> will
# be reported; but the actual file change (and possible (re)write)
# is based on a (re)read of the file content.

Prepare to write again to the current file (after close).
Starts with empty file.

Marks the printed contents as invalid. The existing file will not be
altered.

Option C<msg> to add custom message to verbose reporting.

Returns a string with the contents of the file, so far. It overloads
C<"">, so it's now possible to do "$fh" and get the contents of the
file so far.

Convenience methods to access the log/reporter instance that might
be passed during initialisation and set to C<*$self->{LOG}>.

}

=item is_verbose

Determine if the reporter level is verbose.
If it can't be determined from the reporter instance,
use the global C<CAF::Reporter> state.

Supports boolean option C<verbose_logfile> to check if
reporting to logfile is verbose.

=item event

Method to track an event via LOG C<CAF::History> instance (if any).

Following metadata is added

=over

=item filename

Adds the filename as metadata

=back

=cut

sub event

=back

=head2 Private methods

=over

=item _read_contents

Read the contents from file C<filename> using C<LC::File::file_contents>
and return it.

Optional named arguments

=over

=item event

A hashref that will be updated in place if an error occured. The C<error>
attribute is set to the exception text.

=item missing_ok

When true and C<LC::File::file_contents> fails with C<ENOENT>
(i.e. when C<filename> is missing),
the exception is ignored and no warning is reported.

=back

By default, a warning is reported in case of an error and the exception is (re)thrown.

=cut

sub _read_contents
{
    my ($self, $filename, %opts) = @_;

    $self->debug(2, "Reading initial contents from $filename");

=item DESTROY

Class destructor. Closes the file, perhaps saving it to disk.

{
    my $self = shift;
    $self->close();
    $self->SUPER::DESTROY();

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Opening /etc/sudoers

This a part of what I<ncm-sudo> should do, if it used this module:

    my $fh = CAF::FileWriter->open ("/etc/sudoers", mode => 0440,
                                    log => $self);
    print $fh "User_Alias\t$_\n" foreach @{$aliases->{USER_ALIASES()}};
    print $fh "Runas_Alias\t$_\n" foreach @{$aliases->{RUNAS_ALIASES()}};
    ...
    $fh->close();

Which is actually simpler and safer than current code.

=head2 Specifying owner and group

Owner and group are set at the time of creating the object:

    my $fh = CAF::FileWriter->open ("/some/file",
                                    owner => 100
                                    group => 200);
    print $fh "Hello, world!\n";
    # I don't like what I did, just drop the changes:
    $fh->cancel();
    $fh->close();

=head2 Changing the default filehandle

If you don't want C<STDOUT> as your default filehandle, you can just
C<select> a C<CAF::FileWriter> object:

    my $fh = CAF::FileWriter->open ("/some/file",
                                    owner => 100,
                                    group => 200);
    select ($fh);
    print "Hello, world!\n";
    $fh->close();
    select (STDOUT);

=head2 Using here-documents

You can use them, as always:

    my $fh = CAF::FileWriter->open ("/some/file");
    print $fh <<EOF
    Hello, World!
    EOF
    $fh->close();

=head2 Closing when destroying

If you forget to explictly close the C<CAF::FileWriter> object, it
will be closed automatically when it is destroyed:

    my $fh = CAF::FileWriter->open ("/some/file");
    print $fh "Hello, world!\n";
    undef $fh;

=head1 SEE ALSO

This package inherits from L<IO::String(3pm)>. Check its man page to
do powerful things with the already printed contents.

=head1 TODO

This has became too heavy: in some circumstances, manipulating a file
involves opening it three times, reading it twice and executing two
commands. We probably need to drop LC::* and do things in our own way.
