=head1 NAME

CAF::Process - Class for running commands in CAF applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use CAF::Process;
    my $proc = CAF::Process->new ([qw (my command)], log => $self);
    $proc->pushargs (qw (more arguments));
    my $output = $proc->output();
    $proc->execute();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a convenient wrapper to LC::Process
functions. Commands are logged at the verbose level.

All these methods return the return value of their LC::Process
equivalent. This is different from the command's exit status, which is
stored in C<$?>.

Please use these functions, and B<do not> use C<``>, C<qx//> or
C<system>. These functions won't spawn a subshell, and thus are more
secure.

=head2 Private methods

=over

=item C<_initialize>

Initialize the process object. Arguments:

=over

=item C<$command>

A reference to an array with the command and its arguments.

=item C<%opts>

A hash with the command options:

=over

=item C<log>

The log object. If not supplied, no logging will be performed.

=item C<timeout>

Maximum execution time, in seconds, for the command. If it's too slow
it will be killed.

=item C<pid>

Reference to a scalar that will hold the child's PID.

=item C<stdin>

Data to be passed to the child's stdin

=item C<stdout>

Reference to a scalar that will have child's stdout

=item C<stderr>

Reference to a scalar that will hold the child's stderr.

=item C<keeps_state>

A boolean specifying whether the command respects the current system
state or not. A command that C<keeps_state> will be executed,
regardless of any value for C<NoAction>.

By default, commands modify the state and thus C<keeps_state> is
false.

=item C<sensitive>

A boolean, hashref or functionref specifying whether the arguments contain
sensitive information (like passwords).

If C<sensitive> is true, the commandline will not be reported
(by default when C<log> option is used, the commandline is reported
with verbose level).

If C<sensitive> is a hash reference, a basic search (key) and replace (value) is performed.
The keys and values are not interpreted as regexp patterns. The order of the search and
replace is determined by the sorted values (this gives you some control over the order).
Be aware that all occurences are replaced, and when e.g. weak passwords are used,
it might reveal the password by replacing other parts of the commandline
(C<--password=password> might be replaced by C<--SECRET=SECRET>,
thus revealing the weak password).
Also, when a key is a substring of another key,
it will reveal (parts of) sensitive data if the order is not correct.

If C<sensitive> is a function reference, the command arrayref is passed
as only argument, and the stringified return value is reported.

    my $replace = sub {
        my $command = shift;
        return join("_", @$command);
    };

    ...

    CAF::Process->new(..., sensitive => $replace);

This does not cover command output. If the output (stdout and/or stderr) contains
sensitve information, make sure to handle it yourself via C<stdout> and/or C<stderr>
options (or by using the C<output> method).

=item C<user>

Run command as effective user. The C<user> can be an id (all digits) or a name.

This only works when the current user is root.

In case a non-root user uses this option, or C<user> is not a valid user,
the initialisation will work but any actual execution will fail.

=item C<group>

Run command with effective group. The C<group> can be an id (all digits) or a name.

If C<user> is defined, and C<group> is not, the users primary group will be used
(instead of the default root group).

This only works when the current user is root.

In case a non-root user uses this option, or C<group> is not a valid group,
the initialisation will work but any actual execution will fail.

=back

These options will only be used by the execute method.

=item _sensitive_commandline

Generate the reported command line text, in particular it deals with
the C<sensitive> attribute.
When the sensitive attribute is not set, it returns C<stringify_command>.

This method does not report, only returns text.

See the description of the C<sensitive> option in C<_initialize>.

    return $text;
}

=item _LC_Process

Run C<LC::Process> C<function> with arrayref arguments C<args>.

C<noaction_value> is is the value to return with C<NoAction>.

C<msg> and C<postmsg> are used to construct log message
C<< <msg> command: <COMMAND>[ <postmsg>] >>.

}

=over

=item stream_output

Execute the commands using C<execute>, but the C<stderr> is
redirected to C<stdout>, and C<stdout> is processed with C<process>
function. The total output is aggregated and returned when finished.

Extra option is the process C<mode>. By default (or value C<undef>),
the new output is passed to C<process>. With mode C<line>, C<process>
is called for each line of output (i.e. separated by newline), and
the remainder of the output when the process is finished.

Another option are the process C<arguments>. This is a reference to the
array of arguments passed to the C<process> function.
The arguments are passed before the output to the C<process>: e.g.
if C<< arguments =\> [qw(a b)] >> is used, the C<process> function is
called like C<process(a,b,$newoutput)> (with C<$newoutput> the
new streamed output)

Example usage: during a C<yum install>, you want to stop the yum process
when an error message is detected.

    sub act {
        my ($self, $proc, $message) = @_;

=head1 COMMON USE CASES

On the next examples, no log is used. If you want your component to
log the command, just add C<< log => $self >> to the object creation.

=head2 Running a command

First, create the command:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-lh"]);

Then, choose amongst:

    $proc->run();
    $proc->execute();

=head2 Emulating backticks to get a command's output

Create the command:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-lh"]);

And get the output:

    my $output = $proc->output();

=head2 Piping into a command's stdin

Create the contents to be piped:

    my $contents = "Hello, world";

Create the command, specifying C<$contents> as the input, and
C<execute> it:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["cat", "-"], stdin => $contents);
    $proc->execute();

=head2 Piping in and out

Suppose we want a bi-directional pipe: we provide the command's stdin,
and need to get its output and error:

    my ($stdin, $stdout, $stderr) = ("Hello, world", undef, undef);
    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["cat", "-"], stdin => $stdin,
                                  stdout => \$stdout
                                  stderr => \$stderr);
    $proc->execute();

And we'll have the command's standard output and error on $stdout and
$stderr.

=head2 Creating the command dynamically

Suppose you want to add options to your command, dynamically:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-l"]);
    $proc->pushargs ("-a", "-h");
    if ($my_expression) {
        $proc->pushargs ("-S");
    }

    # Runs ls -l -a -h -S
    $proc->run();

=head2 Subshells

Okay, you B<really> want them. You can't live without them. You found
some obscure case that really needs a shell. Here is how to get
it. But please, don't use it without a B<good> reason:

    my $cmd = CAF::Process->new(["ls -lh|wc -l"], log => $self,
                                 shell => 1);
    $cmd->execute();

It will only work with the C<execute> method.
