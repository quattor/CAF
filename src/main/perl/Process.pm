=head1 NAME

CAF::Process - Class for running commands in CAF applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use CAF::Process;
    my $proc = CAF::Process->new ([qw (my command)], log => $self);
    $proc->pushargs (qw (more arguments));
    my $output = $proc->output();
    $proc->execute();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a convenient wrapper to LC::Process
functions. Commands are logged at the verbose level.

All these methods return the return value of their LC::Process
equivalent. This is different from the command's exit status, which is
stored in $?.

Please use these functions, and B<do not> use C<``> or
C<system>. These functions won't spawn a subshell, and thus are more
secure.

=head2 Private methods

=over

=item C<_initialize>

Initialize the process object. Arguments:

=over

=item C<$command>

A reference to an array with the command and its arguments.

=item C<%opts>

A hash with the command options:

=over

=item C<log>

The log object. If not supplied, no logging will be performed.

=item C<timeout>

Maximum execution time, in seconds, for the command. If it's too slow
it will be killed.

=item C<pid>

Reference to a scalar that will hold the child's PID.

=item C<stdin>

Data to be passed to the child's stdin

=item C<stdout>

Reference to a scalar that will have child's stdout

=item C<stderr>

Reference to a scalar that will hold the child's stderr.

=item C<keeps_state>

A boolean specifying whether the command respects the current system
state or not. A command that C<keeps_state> will be executed,
regardless of any value for C<NoAction>.

By default, commands modify the state and thus C<keeps_state> is
false.

=back

These options will only be used by the execute method.

=head2 Public methods

=over

=item execute

Runs the command, with the options passed at initialization time. If
running on verbose mode, the exact command line and options are
logged.

Please, initialize the object with C<log => ''> if you are passing
confidential data as an argument to your command.

Returns the output of the command. The output will not be logged for
security reasons.

	return "";
    }

    return LC::Process::output (@{$self->{COMMAND}});
}

=over

=item toutput

Returns the output of the command, that will be run with the timeout
passed as an argument. The output will not be logged for security
reasons.

=back

=cut

sub toutput
{
    my ($self, $timeout) = @_;

    if ($self->noAction()) {
	return "";
    }
    return LC::Process::toutput ($timeout, @{$self->{COMMAND}});
}

=over

=item stream_output

Execute the commands using C<execute>, but the C<stderr> is 
redirected to C<stdout>, and C<stdout> is processed with C<process>
function. The total output is aggregated and returned when finished.

Extra option is the process C<mode>. By default (or value C<undef>), 
the new output is passed to C<process>. With mode C<line>, C<process> 
is called for each line of output (i.e. separated by newline), and 
the remainder of the output when the process is finished.

Another option are the process C<arguments>. This is a reference to the
array of arguments passed to the C<process> function. 
The arguments are passed before the output to the C<process>: e.g.
if C<arguments =\> [qw(a b)]> is used, the C<process> function is 
called like C<process(a,b,$newoutput)> (with C<$newoutput> the 
new streamed output)

Example usage: during a C<yum install>, you want to stop the yum process 
when an error message is detected.

    sub act {
        my ($self, $proc, $message) = @_;
        if ($message =~ m/error/) {
            $self->error("Error encountered, stopping process: $message");
            $proc->stop;
        }
    }

    $self->info("Going to start yum");
    my $p = CAF::Process->new([qw(yum install error)], input => 'init');
    $p->stream_output(\&act, mode => line, arguments => [$self, $p]);

=item is_executable

Checks if the first element of the

It returns the result of the C<-x> test on the filename 
(or C<undef> if filename can't be resolved).

If the filename is equal to the C<basename>, then the 
filename to test is resolved using the 
C<File::Which::which> method.  
(Use C<./script> if you want to check a script in the 
current working directory).

=head1 COMMON USE CASES

On the next examples, no log is used. If you want your component to
log the command, just add log => $self to the object creation.

=head2 Running a command

First, create the command:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-lh"]);

Then, choose amongst:

    $proc->run();
    $proc->execute();

=head2 Emulating backticks to get a command's output

Create the command:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-lh"]);

And get the output:

    my $output = $proc->output();

=head2 Piping into a command's stdin

Create the contents to be piped:

    my $contents = "Hello, world";

Create the command, specifying C<$contents> as the input, and
C<execute> it:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["cat", "-"], stdin => $contents);
    $proc->execute();

=head2 Piping in and out

Suppose we want a bi-directional pipe: we provide the command's stdin,
and need to get its output and error:

    my ($stdin, $stdout, $stderr) = ("Hello, world", undef, undef);
    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["cat", "-"], stdin => $stdin,
                                  stdout => \$stdout
                                  stderr => \$stderr);
    $proc->execute();

And we'll have the command's standard output and error on $stdout and
$stderr.

=head2 Creating the command dynamically

Suppose you want to add options to your command, dynamically:

    my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-l"]);
    $proc->pushargs ("-a", "-h");
    if ($my_expression) {
        $proc->pushargs ("-S");
    }

    # Runs ls -l -a -h -S
    $proc->run();

=head2 Subshells

Okay, you B<really> want them. You can't live without them. You found
some obscure case that really needs a shell. Here is how to get
it. But please, don't use it without a B<good> reason:

    my $cmd = CAF::Process->new(["ls -lh|wc -l"], log => $self,
                                 shell => 1);
    $cmd->execute();

It will only work with the C<execute> method.
